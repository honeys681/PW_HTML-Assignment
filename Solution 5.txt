The Document Type Declaration as DOCTYPE, is an important declaration in HTML, that specifies the type of document and version of HTML being used in a web page. It helps web browsers and other user agents understand how to interpret and render the content of the web page.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Document Type</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
